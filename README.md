# cats_dogs_image_classification
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images of cats and dogs. This project uses deep learning techniques to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog, trained on the popular Dogs vs Cats dataset. The model demonstrates the power of CNNs for image classification tasks and achieves high accuracy on test data.
